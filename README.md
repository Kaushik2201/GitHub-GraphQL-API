Mentors : Vedant Tarale and Anirudh Prabhakaran 

What I have understood from the Problem Statement 
We have to fetch data from user's GitHub account and make a interface to display it. Using GraphQL API

Things I have displayed 
* User Info
  Contains
  * Name of User
  * UserName
  * Bio
  * Email
  * Creation date of user account
  * Profile picture
* Top 7 Repositories of the user
* 2 Commits each of those top 7 repositories
* Commit History as Heat Map from first 10 repositories


  Technologies used - `Python` `HTML` and `CSS`

  
  API used - `GraphQL`
  

* Here is the list of few `Python` libraries I have used and needs to be installed before running the code
    * requests
    * Flask
    * Matplotlib - For Heat Map

* Looks of the web App

* Main Page index.html
  * In this page we need to enter the GitHub username whose data we need to fetch
